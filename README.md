# Maven_Market_PowerBi_Project

I am sharing my PowerBI Desktop project, Maven Market Report, which provides insights into the overall performance of Maven Market which is a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. This is a part of the Microsoft PowerBI Desktop for Business Intelligence (2023) course by Maven Analytics on Udemy. 


Steps Involved:-

# 1️⃣ Connecting & Shaping Data:
This step involved extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) project data using Power Query and exploring query editing tools like text, numerical, date & and time tools, grouping & and aggregating tools, etc. during the table transformation stage.


# 2️⃣ Creating a Relational Data Model:
Connect Transaction_Data to Customers, Products, and Stores using valid primary/foreign keys. 
All relationships follow one-to-many cardinality, with primary keys (1) on the lookup side and foreign keys (*) on the data side
Filters are all one-way (no two-way filters), Filter context flows "downstream" from lookup tables to data tables


# 3️⃣ Adding Calculated Fields with DAX:

- Using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), created calculated columns & and measures like - 'Total Revenue', 'Total Transactions', 'YTD Revenue', '% Weekend Transactions', '60-day Revenue', 'All Transactions', Profit Target, Revenue Target etc.
- Explored Math & and stats functions, Conditional & logical functions, Text functions, Date & time functions, RELATED functions, CALCULATE, ALL, Iterator (X) functions, and many more.


# 4️⃣ Visualizing Data with Reports:

- And then the final step was about bringing our data to LIFE with reports and dashboards.
- Used visuals like Cards & KPIs, Table & Matrix, Map, Donut Charts, Trend lines, etc. and tools like Conditional formatting and Top N filtering.
- Report slicers, bookmarks, buttons, tooltips, and report navigation helped to add interactivity.
