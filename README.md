# Maven_Market_PowerBi_Project

I am sharing my PowerBI Desktop project, Maven Market Report, which provides insights into the overall performance of Maven Market which is a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. This is a part of the Microsoft PowerBI Desktop for Business Intelligence (2023) course by Maven Analytics on Udemy. 


STEPS INVOLVED:-

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connecting & Shaping Data:
This step involved extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) project data using Power Query and exploring query editing tools like text, numerical, date & and time tools, grouping & and aggregating tools, etc. during the table transformation stage.


# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Relational Data Model:
In the MODEL view, meticulously organized tables into a coherent data model by establishing one-to-many relationships with primary and foreign keys, ensuring filter context propagation, and creating a snowflake schema linking Stores to Regions. Additionally, refined the data by formatting date fields, currency values, and categorizing location-related attributes, culminating in an enhanced and structured data model for analysis.


# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Calculated Fields with DAX:

- Utilized various DAX functions for calculated columns and measures, including DATE, SEARCH, SUM, COUNTROWS, DIVIDE, FILTER, TOTALYTD, and more to facilitate data analysis, trend analysis, and financial calculations.
-  Using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), created calculated columns & and measures like - 'Total Revenue', 'Total Transactions', 'YTD Revenue', '% Weekend Transactions', '60-day Revenue', 'All Transactions', Profit Target, Revenue Target etc.
- Explored Math & and stats functions, Conditional & logical functions, Text functions, Date & time functions, RELATED functions, CALCULATE, ALL, Iterator (X) functions, and many more.


# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualizing Data with Reports:

- Designed a comprehensive report featuring visuals like Matrix, KPI Cards, Map, Treemap, Column Chart, and Gauge Chart for data analysis. 
- Applied formatting, interactivity,Top N filtering, slicers, and bookmarks to enhance user experience and provide insights
- And then the final step was about bringing our data to LIFE with reports and dashboards.
-  and tools like Conditional formatting.
