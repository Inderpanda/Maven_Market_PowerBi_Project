# Maven_Market_PowerBi_Project

Hey, 
I am sharing my PowerBI Desktop project, Maven Market Report, which provides insights into the overall performance of Maven Market which is a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. This is a part of the Microsoft PowerBI Desktop for Business Intelligence (2023) course by Maven Analytics on Udemy. While building this dashboard, I followed the instructions given in the course and added a few creative changes of my own.
 

Connecting & Shaping Data:
This step involved extract, transform, and load (ETL)  project data using Power Query, and explore query editing tools like text, numerical, date & time tools, grouping & aggregating tools, etc. during table transformation stage.

‚Ä¢ Creating a Relational Data Model:
Data modeling involved building snowflake schema by creating active & inactive relationships, etc.
Connect Transaction_Data to Customers, Products, and Stores using valid primary/foreign keys.
All relationships follow one-to-many cardinality, with primary keys (1) on the lookup side and foreign keys (*) on the data side
Filters are all one-way (no two-way filters), Filter context flows "downstream" from lookup tables to data tables

‚Ä¢ Adding Calculated Fields with DAX:
- Using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), created calculated columns & measures like - 'Total Revenue', 'Total Transactions', 'YTD Revenue', '% Weekend Transactions', '60-day Revenue', 'All Transactions', Profit Target, Revenue Target etc.
- This helped in exploring Math & stats functions, Conditional & logical functions, Text functions, Date & time functions, RELATED function, CALCULATE, ALL, Iterator (X) functions,  and many more.

‚Ä¢ Visualizing Data with Reports:
- And then final step was about bringing our data to LIFE with reports and dashboards.
- Used visuals like Cards & KPIs, Table & Matrix, Map, Donut Charts, Trend lines, etc. and tools like Conditional formatting, Top N filtering.
- Report slicers, bookmarks, buttons, tooltips, report navigation helped to add interactivity.
